#
# settings.py
#
# This file implements helper functions to load and store the plugin's settings.
# Settings are made available in Python through the dictionary "settings" defined
# in this file.
# On disk, the settings are stored in two different files:
# - Transient settings, such as the most recent import folder, are stored
#   in ./user_data/transient_settings.json
# - All other settings are passed on to Anki's integrated settings manager.
#   This is mostly useful for debugging, because Anki's debug string indicates
#   if the user changed any default settings.
#   See https://addon-docs.ankiweb.net/addon-config.html
#
# The following requirements are met:
# - Save and load settings to a JSON file on disk
# - Missing top-level keys are set to their default values. This means that
#   existing older settings.json files will automatically be updated to
#   work with newer plugin versions.
# - Only modules from Python's standard library are used, because external
#   modules are not available in Anki's Python environment.
#
# Known limitations are:
# - Non-top-level settings are not checked / initialized with their default
#   values if missing. The application logic has to manually check them
#   before using them.
#
#
# Usage example:
#     from .src.settings import settings, initializeSettings, saveSettings
#     initializeSettings()        # initialize the settings dictionary
#     settings["example"] = 42    # modify the settings dictionary
#     saveSettings()              # save the changes to disk
